# Image Divider

The Image Divider is a Python utility designed to automatically divide images into four equal parts. This tool is particularly useful for graphic designers, developers, and anyone needing to quickly split images for content creation, website design, or any other purpose.

## Features

- **Batch Processing**: Process an entire folder of images in one go, saving time and effort.
- **Support for Popular Formats**: Works with JPG, JPEG, PNG, and BMP image formats.
- **Simple Usage**: Easy to use with a minimal setup required.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any operating system that supports Python and PIL, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the Image Divider, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system along with the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module. If you don't have PIL installed, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install Pillow
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a folder with the images you wish to divide.
3. Update the `folder` variable in the example usage with the path to your images folder.
4. Run the script using Python:

```
python main.py
```

## Customization

The Image Divider can be easily customized to suit different needs. You can modify the script to change the output image format, the naming convention of divided images, or even the number of divisions.
